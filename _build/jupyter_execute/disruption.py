# # Catastrophic Disruption Scaling
# 
# When the specific energy (energy per unit mass) of a collision begins
# to disturb the gravitational potential energy field of a body, then
# the impact cratering scaling laws are no longer applicable, and
# researchers transition to a scaling system based on a catastrophic
# disruption curve.
# 
# Catastrophic disruption is jargon in the impact community that refers
# to a criteria to remove half the mass of the target or half the mass
# of the colliding bodies.
