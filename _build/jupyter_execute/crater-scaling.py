# # Impact Cratering Scaling Laws
# 
# Most crater scaling laws are based on deriving (typically power-law)
# relationships between non-dimensional variables, which are constructed
# using Buckingham Pi theory. Here is a <a

# ## Online crater scaling tools
# 
# Note that the first two online calculators assume a gravitational accelartion
# for the Moon and Earth, respectively. To first order, the transient
# crater size on other bodies is scaled by the ratio of the gravitational accelerations.

# ### WARNINGS! Things to keep in mind
# 
# These scaling laws are developed in a homogeneous, flat (planar)
# surface. They do not account for crust-mantle transition or curvature
# of a body and its gravity field. Thus they are not applicable for
# events between similar sized bodies. In these cases, the
# {doc}`disruption` is more appropriate.
# 
# The outcomes of impacts are sensitive to the magnitude of the impact
# velocity. The absolute velocity has a relatively small effect on
# scaling the size of the transient crater. It has a larger effect on
# scaling the amount of melting and vaporization, because shock-induced
# melting and vaporization requires reaching specific peak pressures.
