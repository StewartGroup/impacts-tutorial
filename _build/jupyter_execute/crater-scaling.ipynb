    "### WARNINGS! Things to keep in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "These scaling laws are developed in a homogeneous, flat (planar)\n",
    "surface. They do not account for crust-mantle transition or curvature\n",
    "of a body and its gravity field. Thus they are not applicable for\n",
    "events between similar sized bodies. In these cases, the\n",
    "{doc}`disruption` is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of impacts are sensitive to the magnitude of the impact\n",
    "velocity. The absolute velocity has a relatively small effect on\n",
    "scaling the size of the transient crater. It has a larger effect on\n",
    "scaling the amount of melting and vaporization, because shock-induced\n",
    "melting and vaporization requires reaching specific peak pressures.\n",
