## CIDER 2022 Collisions on Early Earth Lecture

These materials support the <b>Collisions on Early Earth</a> lecture at <a

### Ask questions! now and later

Please use this <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xMdyZLr_zDUPdABIcId-6tcAGIu0qJZ-V1VDw1Plfg/edit?usp=sharing"
target="_blank">google document to ask questions</a> related to impacts on
early Earth. The CIDER group can help answer. (You can ask STS about
chondrules too......)

## Tutorial #2 Impact Cratering & Scaling 

The purpose of this Tutorial is to introduce you to a toolkit to be
able to quickly estimate the order of magnitude outcomes of a
planetary collision.
<ul>
<li>Impact cratering size scaling</li>
<li>Peak pressures, decay with depth, volume of melt and vapor</li>
<li>Environmental effects of cratering scaling</li>
<li>Catastrophic disruption scaling: fragmentation of asteroids to
giant impacts</li>
</ul>

This tutorial does not cover an introduction to shock compression 
techniques for geophysical applications. Refer to this review article: 
{cite}`Asimow2015`.
