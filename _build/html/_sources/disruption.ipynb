    "Generally, the outcome of collisions between similar-sized bodies can\n",
    "fall into some general categories: (1) perfect merging (negligible\n",
    "mass in ejected fragments -- dark blue region in figure below); (2)\n",
    "partial accretion (the larger body gains mass); (3) net erosion (the\n",
    "larger body loses mass); (4) hit-and-run (small change to larger\n",
    "body's mass). In the figure below, the thick black line with the\n",
    "critical energy for half the combined mass remaining ($Q^*_{RD}$). The\n",
    "outcomes depend on the mass ratio of the bodies, the impact\n",
    "velocities, and the impact angle, where $b$ is the impact parameter\n",
    "(sine of the impact angle where head on is 0 degrees). $V_{esc}$ is\n",
    "the mutual escape velocity. $M_p$ is the projectile mass; $M_{targ}$\n",
    "is the target mass; $V_i$ is the impact velocity. The impact angle\n",
    "axis is normalized by probability (e.g., 1/4 of all events occur\n",
    "between 0 and 30 degrees).\n",
