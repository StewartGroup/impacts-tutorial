# Tutorial Homework

Using the tools introduced in this tutorial, you should be able to calculate
order of magnitude estimates for the following problems.

The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6ysy2vET17IcbduLlOjisopLu25ogzk/view?usp=sharing">introductory slides for the tutorial</a> are available here.

Impact animations are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqDSwCRG0WrnlZaIRCd-_Q">STS's YouTube Channel</a>.

## Asteroid vs. comet?

You observe a 10 km diameter crater on Mars. Assume typical asteroids collide
around 7 km/s and typical comets collide at 45 km/s. Estimate the
diameters of the asteroid or comet that could have made the crater
using the crater scaling tool for any body. How much smaller is the
comet compared to the asteroid? See {doc}`crater-scaling`. 

## Deep Impact

NASA's Deep Impact mission sent a copper-tipped guided missile into
comet Tempel 1 at 10.2 km/s. What was the peak pressure in the comet,
assuming it was made of pure ice?

Use the {doc}`impedance-match` tool.

What happens to the ice at these peak pressures? Use Table 1 from
{cite}`Kraus2011`.

## Make a pond on Europa

Europa gravitational acceleration is 1.314 m/s$^2$. Assume impact
velocity of 26 km/s for a 370 m Kuiper Belt Object onto Europa.

Estimate the final crater size using the crater scaling tools using
the Purdue (Melosh-Beyer) tool assuming the target is liquid water to
approximate ice.

Estimate the mass of ice that is melted using the crater scaling
function from {cite}`Kraus2011` (Equations 12 and 13):

Here $\phi$ is porosity (assume 0); $\theta$ is the impact angle --
assume 45 degrees; $E_M$ is the melt energy (Table 1 above); $U$ is
the impact velocity; $M_i$ is the impactor mass; $M_{M+V}$ is the mass
of melt and vapor; $M_V$ is the mass of vapor.

Estimate the depth of the water pond within the crater.

## Safe viewing distance?

You are standing outside in the location of New York City when the
Chesapeake Bay impact crater forms (about 500 km away). What does the
radiation do to your body? What was the magnitude of the seismic shaking from the event?

You are standing outside in the location of Berkeley, CA when the
Chicxulub crater forms in Mexico (about 1000 km away). What does the
radiation do to your body? What was the magnitude of the seismic shaking from the event?

## Water for the Belters

The Belters are out of water and have decided to disrupt Ceres for its
ice. They plan to put thrusters on Vesta to collide into Ceres. What
impact velocity is needed to reach catastrophic disruption of Ceres?
Use the {doc}`disruption` tool.
