# Tutorial Homework

Using the tools introduced in this tutorial, you should be able to calculate
order of magnitude estimates for the following problems.

## Asteroid vs. comet?

You observe a 10 km diameter crater on Mars. Assume typical asteroids collide
around 7 km/s and typical comets collide at 45 km/s. Estimate the
diameters of the asteroid or comet that could have made the crater
using the crater scaling tool for any body. How much smaller is the
comet compared to the asteroid? See {doc}`crater-scaling`. 

## Make a pond on Titan






## Safe viewing distance?

You are standing outside in the location of New York City when the
Chesapeake Bay impact crater forms (about 500 km away). What does the
radiation do to your body? What was the magnitude of the seismic shaking from the event?

You are standing outside in the location of Berkeley, CA when the
Chicxulub crater forms in Mexico (about 1000 km away). What does the
radiation do to your body? What was the magnitude of the seismic shaking from the event?

## Water for the Belters

The Belters are out of water and have decided to disrupt Ceres for its
ice. They plan to put thrusters on Vesta to collide into Ceres. What
impact velocity is needed to reach catastrophic disruption of Ceres?
Use the {doc}`disruption` tool.
