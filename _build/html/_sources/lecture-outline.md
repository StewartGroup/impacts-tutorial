## Part I: The Moon-Forming Giant Impact

The Moon-forming giant impact (MFI) marks the end of Earth's main stage of
accretion. It is the last extremely energetic collision that left
a strong chemical signatures related to metal-silicate equilibration
and atmospheric-mantle equilibration. Usually, it is assumed that
chemical effects from core formation are limited/negligible after the
MFI.

Previously, most scientists assumed that the Earth's mantle was
well-mixed due to the MFI and began considering Earth's
evolution from a homogeneous magma ocean. Today, we know that Earth's lower
mantle preserves gases obtained from the solar nebula that have not
been mixed away from one or more giant impacts and subsequent mantle
evolution. The implications of this constraint on core formation
processes and mantle dynamical evolution are still at the forefront of research.

Guiding questions (for this lecture):<br>
<ul>
	<li>What circumstances made Earth’s Moon? Do the details matter?</li>
	<li>What factors determined the chemical and isotopic similarity
	between Earth & Moon?</li>
	<li>What kind of chemical perturbations (core formation,
	atmosphere equilibration, atm loss?) are a result of giant
	impacts/Moon formation?</li>
	<li>Can the Moon’s formation scenario be used to constrain overall planet formation and vice versa?</li>
	</ul>

Current Limitations & Needs:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Giant impact models leave a lot out:
	<ul>
		<li>Typical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations are low resolution (100’s km) </li>
		<li>no heat transport &rarr; enhances thermal gradients</li>
		<li>inhibits mixing (turbulence and chemical dissolution) &rarr;
		leads to artificial separation of materials</li>
		<li>Need to tackle more realistic material models (equations
		of state and rheology)
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Post-impact evolution
	<ul>
		<li>Need convergence of lunar dynamical evolution models for lunar inclination & AM transfer</li>
		<li>Need real coupling between chemistry & physics in lunar
		accretion models and Earth interior models</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Statistical arguments are limited
	<ul>
		<li>Some arguments based on statistics of planet formation
		context; e.g., how many and what type of impact parameters;
		how close did the impactor form in the solar system, etc.</li>
		<li>Hard to compare scenarios; hard to assign
		probabilities</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

## Part II: Late Accretion delivers metals and volatiles

After formation of the Moon, approximately 0.5wt% of Earth's mass was
added {cite}`Drake2002`. The main evidence for this 'late accretion' is the presence of
highly siderophile elements (HSE) in the mantle at abundances far
greater than expected from metal-silicate equilibration during core
formation. The relative proportions of the HSEs (e.g., platiunum group
elements) is similar to that found in bulk chondrites, which is
interpreted as a late delivery by planetesimals without communication
with the core.

Previously, late accretion (also called the late veneer; some subtle
differences in usage are explained in {cite}`Morbidelli2015`) was assumed
to deliver much of Earth's volatiles. Today, we know that most of
Earth's water and other volatiles were delivered during the main stage
of planet formation and only a small portion of major volatiles were
delivered late {cite}`Halliday2013`. However, some rare gases in the
atmosphere are dominated by delivery
from late accretion (e.g., Xe, Kr). 

Guiding questions:<br>
<ul>
	<li>What bodies delivered HSE to the early Earth? What sizes, what compositions?</li>
	<li>What constraints are placed on overall planet formation from
	these late impactors? What is the compositional evolution of small and large bodies?</li>
	<li>How was the mass incorporated into the Earth? How did these impacts perturb the Earth’s environment?</li>
	</ul>

Current limitations & needs:<br>
<ul>
	<li>What are the sources and compositions of late accretion bodies?</li>
	<li>The sizes of late bodies are poorly known. We need to track small bodies to end of planet formation.</li>
	<li>Need better tracking of composition of main bodies and debris
during planet formation</li>
</ul>

## Part III: Environmental Perturbations from Early Bombardment

The Earth was constructed in a much more reduced environment compared
to Earth's surface today. How quickly did the Earth's surface
enviroment evolve and did transient (global or regional) reducing
conditions exist that could aid pre-biotic chemistry. Late accretion
delivers metals, which release H<sub>2</sub> upon oxidation by
water. A recent hypothesis for a single large impact event producing a
relatively long-lived hydrogen-rich atmosphere has motivated new
interest in the chemical perturbations from late accretion.

Good reference for early oxidation of the surface environment: {cite}`Kasting2014`

Guiding questions:<br>
<ul>
<li>How did late impactors affect the Earth’s environment?
	<ul>
		<li>Atmospheric ejection & delivery (Schlichting et al. 2012)</li>
		<li>Production of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (Zahnle et
		al. PSJ 2020)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Where were metals deposited? When and where were they oxidized?
	(Genda et al. EPSl 2017; Citron & Stewart PSJ 2022; Itcovitz et al. PSJ 2022)</li>
</ul>

Current limitations & needs:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Predicting outcomes needs size-velocity & composition!</li>
	<li>Hard to model the distribution of metal; requires development for strength models for the mantle, temperature, and turbulent mixing/comminution</li>
	<li>Need redox-chemistry in supercritical fluids</li>
	<li>Need to understand how the mantle cools and recovers; does
	iron diapir to the core?</li>
</ul>
